# Retail Sales Analysis: What’s Driving Growth, Where Risk Is Building, and Why It Matters

## Audience:
Head of Retail / Commercial Manager

## Purpose

This analysis reviews retail performance across revenue growth, demand behaviour, pricing, category mix, and store performance to support commercial and operational decisions. The focus is on identifying what is driving results today, where risk is accumulating, and which actions are justified.

## Data

Anonymised transaction-level retail data covering multiple stores and product categories (2022–2025), including sales value, units sold, transactions, and realised prices.

## Approach

Performance is assessed through trend analysis, price-versus-volume comparisons, and benchmarking of stores within comparable formats to separate structural drivers from seasonal effects.

## Headline conclusions

* Revenue growth is increasingly price-led rather than demand-led, with rising prices offsetting declining volume and transactions.

* Pricing remains disciplined overall, with temporary promotional dips rather than sustained price erosion.

* Value is concentrated in bags and a small number of consistently strong stores, creating concentration risk.

* Demand is heavily concentrated on Saturdays, making overall performance more dependent on a limited number of peak days.

* Several stores underperform structurally, indicating positioning and execution issues rather than timing effects.

## Bottom line

The business is growing, but becoming more fragile. Revenue is increasingly supported by price, a narrow set of categories, a small number of high-performing stores, and a limited set of peak demand days.
